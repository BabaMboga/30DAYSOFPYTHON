# 30DAYSOFPYTHON

This is an open-source project guide for learning Python Programming Language .

Fork it and create separate branches/folders for each day. 

## Topics Breakdown

### Day 1: Python Basics
Start by installing Python and a text editor. Learn the basics of Python, such as: 
 variables, data types, Math Operators, Comments, Input() function, Print() function, The str(), int(), and float() Functions

#### Exercise
Advanced Calculator Program: Simple Calculator
Create a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
Display a menu with the following options:
a. Addition (+)
b. Subtraction (-)
c. Multiplication (*)
d. Division (/)
e. Exit
Prompt the user to choose an option by entering the corresponding letter (a, b, c, d, or e).
If the user chooses an arithmetic operation (a, b, c, or d), prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Perform the selected arithmetic operation on the entered numbers and display the result.
If the user chooses "Exit" (e), end the program.
If the user enters an invalid option, display an error message and return to the menu.
Repeat steps 2-6 until the user chooses to exit.


### Day 2: Python Control Flow - IF Statements, Logical and Comparator Operations

Learn how to use control flow statements like if-else statements, Switch-Case Statement,Logical Operators (and, OR), Boolean operators and comparisonooperations such as <, >, !==, ==, etc

#### Exercise

You are building a program to help a user decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the current temperature in Fahrenheit and whether it is currently raining or not (as a boolean value), and then suggests an appropriate outfit based on the following criteria:

If the temperature is less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit, suggest wearing a coat, hat, scarf, and gloves. If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a sweater or light jacket. If the temperature is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a rain jacket and boots. If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is not raining, suggest wearing a t-shirt and shorts. If the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit and it is raining, suggest wearing a light jacket and rain boots.

### Day 3: Loops and Iteration in Python 

Understand how to apply Loops and iteration in python programs. *** While loops:With boolean values, do-while loop too *** For Loops: Using Indexing,using range(), Using items, looping over sequential data (sets, dictionaries, lists, tuples) *** For-Else statements *** Break and Continue Statements

Exercise
Fibonacci: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer n, and then prints the first n Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
